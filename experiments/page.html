                <h3>Our Story So Far</h3>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It all started back in 2019 for me, when legendary youtuber <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/PewDiePie">PewDiePie</a> started his
                <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGt-BZ-SxGI&list=PLYH8WvNV1YEnLCzUDWueIZQXDNhqLKywk">"Minecraft Lets Play Series"</a>
                . That was the year i got my first job and was able to afford my first ever PC. I along with my friends and
                partner started a world we now call "Hacienda". As newbies to the game we had a lot of fun exploring the world,
                feeling excitment and fear from the vast content 1.14 had to offer. So far it had been me <a target="_blank" href="#">AlekJay</a>, <a target="_blank" href="#">Sugarunes</a> and <a target="_blank" href="#">Morningrabbit</a>, 
                then in a world lost by "The Merge" came <a target="_blank" href="#">GgEzGetRekt</a>, a veteran in the game. That was the first world where we had big builds,
                where our creativity and skill grew as Minecraft players and it was the first time we had encountered the Ender Dragon.
                GgEzGetRekt had a world of his own along with his online friends, a world which for me was the first SMP i had ever joined.
                That world later became known as <a href="#" target="_blank">Narniaburg</a>, the lognest running SMP we ever had.
                The settlers of these lands where lost to time, leaving only one member and the newcomeres to shape the world that it is today.
                In late 2019, after feeling home sick, we spent time studying the enchanting table and figured out a spell to bring our old worlds together.
                The Merge brought many but not all relics from the past. In that time a pirate decided to join our world, his name <a target="_blank" href="#">Demonoid99</a>.

                <p> He built his outpost along side a tavern for all the thirsty explorers of the sea. The world was thriving, with so many undergoing projects like:
                    The Underground Tunnels, The Marketplace, The Parlament, The Sword Portal, The Automated Farms and The Nether Hub.
                    It was a time of unity and peace in the world.
                    In early 2020 the informal ruler and owner of the SMP, GgEzGetRekt got hungry with power, disobeying the rules he placed to keep order.
                    Outraged by these events, the settlers demanded GgEzGetRekt to be stripped of his disgracefully acquired belongings, and a vote to be called to
                    pick the new ruler. The power hungry tyrant threatened to end the world if his rule was to be questioned, leaving the settlers no choice 
                    but the search the world for new lands and build their own kingdoms. Free from the strict rules from the mainlands, the settlers had the creative freedom,
                    to build their own kingdoms and designed them as they sought.
                    First came the Winter Biome, a deserted winter paradise where there were a scarce number of buildings.
                    The isolation and the lack of order and coordination was the doom of this potential kingdom, but it was the place where we
                    saw our soon to be recruit <a href="#" target="_blank">Zeta274</a>. This kingdom saw a few architectural contributions, one of them being 
                    the giant Snow Man. The Chicken on the top of the hill and deep in the desert laid the recrated home of the now late Technoblade from the Dream SMP. 
                    Another kingdom grew near the mainlands of called the golden fields.

                <p> Its name orginated by the gigantic wheat fields spreading on its land. Unfortunatly the very feilds this land was named after, became an 
                    ambitious project that died with the server. Its goal was to become a more organized town, meeting all the needs of the common man.
                    The mainlands saw a few more changes before it was put to rest. The server was a monumental achievment for all of us, it had a lifespan
                    of 3 Minecraft generations, spaning from 1.14 to 1.17. <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Dark Ages</b> - In the height of the pandemic our numbers grew stronger, the segregation in the world of Narniaburg forced the memebers to search for new worlds,
                    ones that could meet the demands of the settlers. Here we met Ata, Kensuke21 and Zeta274. In the begining of this world, part of the group sought out to defeat
                    the mighty Ender Dragon in the shortest amount of time, while others gathered recources to supply the wariors on their path to victory.
                    The Ender Dragon was slayed and it was thought to be the end of this servers life. However I, AlekJay decided to call this new world my new home and started
                    cultivating the land, raising farms of wheat, sheep and cows. With the riches of the land came back the wariors and a new settlment was formed. One built with no coordination
                    a world of chaos. This world came with the discovery of the copper and amethyst, materials which were used to build a memorial to honor the Ender Dragon,
                    the soul reason this world came to life.
